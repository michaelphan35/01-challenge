# 01-challenge

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to refactor an existing website and update the HTML file with semantic elements 
and to consildate/clean up the css styles sheet.

HTML and CSS were the technologies used for this project because these two languages allowed for the website
to function in the exact same way even after changes were made to the HTML and CSS. A feature that still can be 
implemented is flexbox--which would enable mobile compatibility.

## How to Access the Project

*Start by pulling/cloning the files related to the project from the GitHub repository. A zip file for the project
can also be downloaded, but the files would need to be extracted afterwards.

*Open the index.html and style.css file using a code editing software such as VS Code.
